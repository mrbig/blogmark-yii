This is a demo application for the Budapest PHP Meetup. It is heavily based
on the yii demo webapplication.

This software requires the yii-1.1.10 framework. Please update the index.php
and protected/yiic.php to point to the location of the framework.

The demo requires a database connection to be set up. Please update
proctected/config/main.php and protected/config/console.php to point to the
correct database instance.
